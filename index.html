  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the past weeks I enjoyed working on reversing a software (don&rsquo;t ask me the name), to study how serial numbers are validated. The story the user has to follow is pretty common: download the trial, pay, get the serial number, use it in the annoying nag screen to get the fully functional version of the software.</p>

<p>Since my purpose is to not damage the company developing the software, I will not mention the name of the software, nor I will publish the final key generator in binary form, nor its source code. My goal is instead to study a real case of serial number validation, and to highlight its weaknesses.</p>

<p>In this post we are going to take a look at the steps I followed to reverse the serial validation process and to make a key generator using <a href="http://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> symbolic virtual machine. We are not going to follow all the details on the reversing part, since you cannot reproduce them on your own. We will concentrate our thoughts on the key-generator itself: that is the most interesting part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I think it all began when I&rsquo;ve worked on the <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/tree/master/NoSuchCon2013">NSC2013</a> crackme made by <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">@elvanderb</a>, long story short you had an AES128 heavily obfuscated white-box implementation to break. The thing was you could actually solve the challenge in different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>the first one was the easiest one: you didn&rsquo;t need to know anything about white-box, crypto or even AES ; you could just see the function as a black-box &amp; try to find &ldquo;design flaws&rdquo; in its inner-workings</li>
<li>the elite way: this one involved to understand &amp; recover the entire design of the white-box, then to identify design weaknesses that allows the challenger to directly attack &amp; recover the encryption key. A really nice write-up has been recently written by <a href="https://twitter.com/doegox">@doegox</a>, check it out, really :): <a href="http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/NSC_Writeups">Oppida/NoSuchCon challenge</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The annoying thing is that you don&rsquo;t have a lot of understandable available C code on the web that implement such things, nevertheless you do have quite some nice academic references ; they are a really good resource to build your own.</p>

<p>This post aims to present briefly, in a simple way what an AES white-box looks like, and to show how its design is important if you want to not have your encryption key extracted :). The implementation I&rsquo;m going to talk about today is not my creation at all, I just followed the first part (might do another post talking about the second part? Who knows) of a really <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/raw/master/wbaes_attack/docs/a_tutorial_on_whitebox_aes.pdf">nice paper</a> (even for non-mathematical / crypto guys like me!) written by James A. Muir.</p>

<p>The idea is simple: we will start from a clean AES128 encryption function in plain C, we will modify it &amp; transform it into a white-box implementation in several steps.
As usual, all the code are available on my github account; you are encourage to break &amp; hack them!</p>

<p>Of course, we will use this post to briefly present what is the white-box cryptography, what are the goals &amp; why it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As last year, the French conference <a href="http://www.nosuchcon.org/#challenge">No Such Con</a> returns for its second edition in Paris from the 19th of November until the 21th of November. And again, the brilliant <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">Eloi Vanderbeken</a> &amp; his mates at <a href="http://synacktiv.fr/en/index.html">Synacktiv</a> put together a series of three security challenges especially for this occasion.
Apparently, the three tasks have already been <a href="https://twitter.com/Synacktiv/status/515174845844582401">solved</a> by awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/0xf4b">@0xfab</a> which won the competition, hats off :).</p>

<p>To be honest I couldn&rsquo;t resist to try at least the first step, as I know that <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">Eloi</a> always builds <a href="http://0vercl0k.tuxfamily.org/bl0g/?p=253">really twisted</a> and <a href="http://www.nosuchcon.org/2013/#challenge">nice binaries</a> ; so I figured I should just give it a go!</p>

<p>But this time we are trying something different though: this post has been co-authored by both <em>Emilien Girault</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/emiliengirault">@emiliengirault</a>) and I. As we have slightly different solutions, we figured it would be a good idea to write those up inside a single post. This article starts with an introduction to the challenge and will then fork, presenting my solution and his.</p>

<p>As the article is quite long, here is the complete table of contents:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>As the blog was a bit silent for quite some time, I figured it would be cool to put together a post ; so here it is folks, dig in!</p>

<p>The French company <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/you-like-python-security-challenge-and-traveling-win-a-free-ticket-to-hitb-kul.html">Quarkslab</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/quarkslab/status/507457671386394624">recently</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HITBSecConf/status/507458788522094592">released</a> a security challenge to win a free entrance to attend the upcoming <a href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/">HITBSecConf</a> conference in Kuala Lumpur from the 13th of October until the 16th.</p>

<p>The challenge has been written by <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/author/serge-guelton.html">Serge Guelton</a>, a R&amp;D engineer specialized in compilers/parallel computations. At the time of writing, already eight different people manage to solve the challenge, and one of the ticket seems to have been won by <code>hackedd</code>, so congrats to him!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/dissection_of_quarkslab_s_2014_security_challenge/woot.png"></p>

<p>According to the description of the challenge Python is heavily involved, which is a good thing for at least two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>first because I already had <a href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/deep-dive-into-pythons-vm-story-of-load_const-bug/">the occasion</a> to look at its source code in the past,</li>
<li>and because I so am a <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/tree/master/Python's%20internals">big fan of Python</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this post I will describe how I tackled this problem, how I managed to solve it. And to make up for me being slow at solving it I tried to make it fairly detailed.</p>

<p>At first it was supposed to be quite short though, but well..I decided to analyze fully the challenge even if it wasn&rsquo;t needed to find the key unfortunately, so it is a bit longer than expected :&ndash;).</p>

<p>Anyway, sit down, make yourself at home and let me pour you a cup of tea before we begin :&ndash;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A few months ago, I was writing a Linux kernel exploitation challenge on ARM in an attempt to learn about kernel exploitation and I thought I&rsquo;d explore things a little. I chose the ARM architecture mainly because I thought it would be fun to look at. This article is going to describe how the ARM Exception Vector Table (EVT) can aid in kernel exploitation in case an attacker has a write what-where primitive. It will be covering a local exploit scenario as well as a remote exploit scenario. Please note that corrupting the EVT has been mentioned in the paper &ldquo;Vector Rewrite Attack&rdquo;<a href="http://cansecwest.com/slides07/Vector-Rewrite-Attack.pdf">[1]</a>, which briefly talks about how it can be used in NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities on an ARM RTOS.</p>

<p>The article is broken down into two main sections. First a brief description of the ARM EVT and its implications from an exploitation point of view (please note that a number of things about the EVT will be omitted to keep this article relatively short). We will go over two examples showing how we can abuse the EVT.</p>

<p>I am assuming the reader is familiar with Linux kernel exploitation and knows some ARM assembly (seriously).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>A year ago, I&rsquo;ve written a Python script to leverage a bug in Python&rsquo;s virtual machine: the idea was to fully control the Python virtual processor and after that to instrument the VM to execute native codes. The <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/blob/master/Python's%20internals/python27_abuse_vm_to_execute_x86_code.py">python27_abuse_vm_to_execute_x86_code.py</a> script wasn&rsquo;t really self-explanatory, so I believe only a few people actually took some time to understood what happened under the hood. The purpose of this post is to give you an explanation of the bug, how you can control the VM and how you can turn the bug into something that can be more useful. It&rsquo;s also a cool occasion to see how works the Python virtual machine from a low-level perspective: what we love so much right?</p>

<p>But before going further, I just would like to clarify a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t found this bug, this is quite old and <strong>known</strong> by the Python developers (trading safety for performance), so don&rsquo;t panic this is <strong>not</strong> a 0day or a new bug ; can be a cool CTF trick though</li>
<li>Obviously, YES I know we can also &ldquo;escape&rdquo; the virtual machine with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> module ; but this is a feature not a bug. In addition, ctypes is always &ldquo;removed&rdquo;  from sandbox implementation in Python</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, keep in mind I will focus Python 2.7.5 x86 on Windows ; but obviously this is adaptable for other systems and architectures, so this is left as an exercise to the interested readers.
All right, let&rsquo;s move on to the first part: this one will focus the essentials about the VM, and Python objects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I am currently playing with pool-based memory corruption vulnerabilities. That’s why I wanted to program a PoC exploit for the vulnerability presented by Tarjei Mandt during his first talk “Kernel Pool Exploitation on Windows 7” <a href="http://www.mista.nu/research/MANDT-kernelpool-PAPER.pdf">[3]</a>. I think it&rsquo;s a good exercise to start learning about pool overflows.</p>

<h1>Forewords</h1>

<p>If you want to experiment with this vulnerability, you should read <a href="http://www.itsecdb.com/oval/definition/oval/gov.nist.USGCB.patch/def/11689/MS10-058-Vulnerabilities-in-TCP-IP-Could-Allow-Elevation-of.html">[1]</a> and be sure to have a vulnerable system. I tested my exploit on a VM with Windows 7 32 bits with tcpip.sys 6.1.7600.16385. The Microsoft bulletin dealing with this vulnerability is MS10-058. It has been found by Matthieu Suiche <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/security/bulletin/ms10-058">[2]</a> and was used as an example on Tarjei Mandt’s paper <a href="http://www.mista.nu/research/MANDT-kernelpool-PAPER.pdf">[3]</a>.</p>

<h1>Triggering the flaw</h1>

<p>An integer overflow in <em>tcpip!IppSortDestinationAddresses</em> allows to allocate a wrong-sized non-paged pool memory chunk. Below you can see the diff between the vulnerable version and the patched version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The purpose of this little post is to create a piece of code able to monitor exceptions raised in a process (a bit like <a href="http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/">gynvael</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=148">ExcpHook</a> but in userland), and to generate a report with information related to the exception. The other purpose is to have a look at the internals of course.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I divided this post in two big parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first one will talk about Windows internals background required to understand how things work under the hood,</li>
<li>the last one will talk about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/"><em>Detours</em></a> and how to hook <em>ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher</em> toward our purpose. Basically, the library gives programmers a set of APIs to easily hook procedures. It also has a clean and readable documentation, so you should use it! It is usually used for that kind of things:

<ul>
<li>Hot-patching bugs (no need to reboot),</li>
<li>Tracing API calls (<a href="http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor">API Monitor</a> like),</li>
<li>Monitoring (a bit like our example),</li>
<li>Pseudo-sandboxing (prevent API calls),</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><em>Kryptonite</em> was a proof-of-concept I built to obfuscate codes at the LLVM intermediate representation level. The idea was to use semantic-preserving transformations in order to not break the original program. One of the main idea was for example to build a home-made 32 bits adder to replace the <em>add</em> LLVM instruction. Instead of having a single asm instruction generated at the end of the pipeline, you will end up with a ton of assembly codes doing only an addition. If you never read my article, and you are interested in it here it is: <a href="http://0vercl0k.tuxfamily.org/bl0g/?p=260">Obfuscation of steel: meet my Kryptonite</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/breaking_kryptonite_s_obfuscation_with_symbolic_execution/home-made-adder.png"></p>

<p>In this post I wanted to show you how we can manage to break that obfuscation with symbolic execution. We are going to write a really tiny symbolic execution engine with IDAPy, and we will use Z3Py to simplify all our equations. Note that a friend of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">@elvanderb</a> used a similar approach (more generic though) to simplify some parts of the <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/overclokblog/Obfuscation%20of%20steel%3a%20meet%20my%20Kryptonite/binaries/">crackme</a> ; but he didn&rsquo;t wanted to publish it, so here is my blog post about it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, I was peacefully coding some stuff you know but I couldn&rsquo;t make my code working.
As usual, in those type of situations you fire up your debugger in order to understand what is going on under the hood.
That was a bit weird, to give you a bit of context I was doing some inline x86 assembly, and I&rsquo;ve put on purpose an <em>int3</em> just
before the piece of assembly code I thought was buggy. Once my file loaded in <a href="http://ollydbg.de/version2.html">OllyDbg2</a>, I hit <em>F9</em> in order to reach quickly the <em>int3</em> I&rsquo;ve slipped into the inline assembly code. A bit of single-stepping, and <strong>BOOM</strong> I got a nasty crash. It happens sometimes, and that&rsquo;s uncool.
Then, I relaunch my binary and try to reproduce the bug: same actions and <strong>BOOM</strong> again. OK, this time it&rsquo;s cool, I got a reproducible crash in OllyDbg2.</p>

<p>I like when things like that happens to me (remember the crashes I&rsquo;ve found in OllyDbg/IDA here: <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/overclokblog/PDB%20ain%27t%20PDD/0vercl0k_pdb_aint_pdd.pdf">PDB Ain&rsquo;t PDD</a>), it&rsquo;s always a nice exercise for me where I&rsquo;ve to:</p>

<ul>
<li>pinpoint the bug in the application: usually not trivial when it&rsquo;s a real/big application</li>
<li>reverse-engineer the codes involved in the bug in order to figure out why it&rsquo;s happening (sometimes I got the sources, sometimes I don&rsquo;t like this time)</li>
</ul>


<p>In this post, I will show you how I&rsquo;ve manage to pinpoint where the bug was, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff549561(v=vs.85).aspx">GFlags, PageHeap</a> and <a href="http://www.windbg.info/">WinDbg</a>. Then, we will reverse-engineer the buggy code in order to understand why the bug is happening, and how we can code a clean trigger.</p>
